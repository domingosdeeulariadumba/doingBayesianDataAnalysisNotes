- Exercise 2.1
Given the models p(x) = 1/4, p(x) = x/10, and p(x) = 12/25x, we can describe the kind of bias (or lack of it) as follows:
    1. The first model describes a fair die, given that whatever the value of x in the sample space the likelihood is the same.
    2. The second model describes a biased die toward high numbered-faces.
    3. The last model describes the opposite of the former, that is, it favours low numbered-faces of the four sided-die.


- Exercise 2.2
Considering the models presented above:
    1. If after rolling the die for 100 times we get 25 counts for each side (#1’s = 25, #2’s = 25, #3’s = 25, #4’s = 25), then we should reallocate our credibility to the first model.
    2. If, on the other hand, the results were #1’s = 48, #2’s = 24, #3’s = 16, #4’s = 12, the model that seems most likely is the third one.
